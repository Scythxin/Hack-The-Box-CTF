Name: Flag Command
Type: Web CTF
Time taken: ~30mins

Opened the provided IP address.

Started the game and tried XML injection, it didn't work.

Opened the console and checked the js files: 
command.js
game.js
main.js

Didn't find anything noteworthy in command.js and game.js.

In main.js found async function CheckMessage(), where I found:
if(data.message.includes('HTB{')) {
                    playerWon();
                    fetchingResponse = false;

                    return;
}

Tried putting it in:
if (currentCommand == 'HEAD NORTH') {
                    currentStep = '2';
                }
in place of 2, didn't work.

Found:
const fetchOptions = () => {
    fetch('/api/options')
        .then((data) => data.json())
        .then((res) => {
            availableOptions = res.allPossibleCommands;

        })
        .catch(() => {
            availableOptions = undefined;
        })
}
the webpage was fetching required information by using an API in JSON format.

Checked the Network tab for more information and found an options GET request.

In options I found:
    "secret": [
      "Blip-blop, in a pickle with a hiccup! Shmiggity-shmack"
    ]
as one of the options. 

Then I started another run and instead of HEAD NORTH I used the above option.

This provided me with the flag:
HTB{D3v3l0p3r_t00l5_4r3_b35t_wh4t_y0u_Th1nk??!_3371bf31609bd21b929a6559225dce73}
