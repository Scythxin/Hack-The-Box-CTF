Downloaded the provided zip file for the CTF.

Checked they file type, it was pcapng.

So I opened the file in WireShark and started going through the files.

All the packets looked similar, some were: Unknown Function, Read Coils, Read Holding Registers, etc.

On capture no. 35 I found the flag, I followed the packet and copied the packet.

Flag was:
