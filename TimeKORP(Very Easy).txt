Time taken: ~30mins

Downloaded the provided files and opened the IP address.

In the website found 2 pages: What's the Time, What's the Date

Checked the filed and found some useful PHP files named: TimeModel.php and TimeController.php

Here GET request was being used to set a value to the variabe $format.

But the value was accessible through the URL, so i tried to change the URL to check for injection.

It worked, so I could try to inject some code through the URL.

Then I tried to inject 'ls' which gave me the output -> views

Therefore, injection was indeed possible.

According to the format I created a payload to check what's inside the '../flag' file:
';cat ../file' -> %27;cat%20../file%27

Got the flag: HTB{t1m3_f0r_th3_ult1m4t3_pwn4g3_9d71aa6f1ba382f487270fdeb4d920f6}
